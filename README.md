## Open Chrome Console
  * Make sure you are on the No Internet Connection page.
  * Right click anywhere on the page and select Inspect.
  * Go to Console tab. This is where we will enter the commands to tweak the game.
## Tweaking Speed
  *Type the following command in Console and press enter. You can use any other speed in place of 1000.*
 * When you want to run:
    `Runner.instance_.setSpeed(1000)`
* When you want to stop:
    `Runner.instance_.setSpeed(10)`
## Immortality
 * After every command press enter. All the commands are case-sensitive.
 * We store the original game over function in a variable:
    `var original = Runner.prototype.gameOver`
 * Then, we make the game over function empty:
    `Runner.prototype.gameOver = function(){}`
  #### Stopping the game after using Immortality
 * When you want to stop the game, Revert back to the original game over function:
      `Runner.prototype.gameOver = original`
## Setting the current score
  * Letâ€™s set the score to 12345. You can set any other score less than 99999. The current score is reset on game over.
    `Runner.instance_.distanceRan = 12345 / Runner.instance_.distanceMeter.config.COEFFICIENT`
## Stand still and gain points
  * It does not move but the score increases
    `Runner.instance_.playingIntro = true;`
  * Stopping the game
    `Runner.instance_.playingIntro = false;`
## Auto Play 
   **Paste all code from the file auto_dino.js**
## jump high
`Runner.instance_.tRex.setJumpVelocity(100)`
## move right or left
   **Paste all code from the file move.js**
## point of speed
  * change 1 to any number the smaller number the faster point of speed: 
`Runner.instance_.msPerFrame = 1`
